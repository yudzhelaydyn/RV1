Parties can receive coverage not only for warranties given at signing, but also for warranties given at closing. The usual instrument to obtain such coverage is the so-called “bring-down concept”, #bring-down-statement  *(See also Giessen/Lüttges, BB 2018, 647 et seq.)* which means that in respect of warranties given at closing (except for title warranties), the seller needs to disclose any facts occurred in the interim period between signing and closing that would constitute a breach of a closing warranty. By this means, all warranties given at closing in the purchase agreement will be covered for unknown risks whereas all facts disclosed by way of the bring-down disclosure are deemed known. Thus, related breaches are excused from cover. The parties of the transaction usually do not agree on any negative consequences for the seller in connection with such disclosure. However, the seller is often still reluctant to follow such concept as closing warranties – which are already granted in the purchase agreement (i.e., at the time of signing) – cover future matters. From a seller’s point of view, this fact results in a higher exposure of a liability for willful misconduct based on the statements into the blue-concept (Aussagen ins Blaue hinein).  paulsAvoidingPitfallsWI2020 2

**Alternatief:** #bring-down-statement/alternatief  In order to provide the seller with more comfort, the seller may not be required to give the warranties at closing in the purchase agreement itself, but rather to grant the warranties again under a separate declaration on or shortly prior to closing (so-called “Closing Warranties Declaration”). The advantage of this concept is that (i) the seller is not required to make future statements, and (ii) even warranties being subject to a knowledge qualifier can then be given as at closing (subject to the respective disclosure by the seller). paulsAvoidingPitfallsWI2020 2

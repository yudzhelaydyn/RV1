There are **four key terms** in an R&W insurance policy: **liability limit, retention, policy period, and premium**. The **liability limit** is the maximum amount that the insurance company will pay for all claims made under the policy. The limit usually, but not always, matches the indemnification amount included in the merger agreement; indeed, the limits are sometimes synthetic, in that the policy provides coverage even in the absence of a contractual seller indemnity. The **retention** represents the initial amount of losses that the insured must pay before insurance coverage applies. Retentions mitigate moral hazard by guaranteeing that the insured bears some of the economic cost of losses. In addition, since the insurer incurs significant administrative overhead, broker commissions, and premium taxes, it is not efficient to insure small or frequent losses. The retention eliminates these costs because the insured pays small claims directly (e.g., Grossman and Hart 1983; Holmstrom 1979; Mirrlees 1999). The **policy period** begins at the acquisition’s closing and ends at an agreed upon expiration date. In order for a claim to be paid, the insurance company must be notified of the loss during the policy period. The **premium** is the amount paid to the insurer for providing coverage when the policy is bound, generally prior to the deal’s close. even-tovRepresentationsWarrantiesInsurance2022 5
